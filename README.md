Now I am an electrician but I want to be a programmer so i need to learn fast .
             I think that programming is very interesting.
             I love the idea that you can travel anywhere and you have your job in laptop. 
             You dont have to back to your city after holiday, you can stay anywhere and work at any hour, bulding interesting things.
             It,s make me feel some  kind of freedom . . .
